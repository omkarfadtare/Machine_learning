# Artificial intelligence (AI)
Artificial intelligence is field of computer science, which leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind with the help of robust datasets.
- ## Machine learning
  - Deep learning
  - Natural language preprocessing
- ## Computer vision
## Machine learning (ML):
It is a subfield or subset or application of Artificial intelligence which enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without being explicitly programmed. Or we can say that, It is a subfield of Artificial intelligence which enables machines to solve problems on thier own and make accurate decisions using provided data. Machine learning requires more human interaction as compared to deep learning.
### Deep learning (DL):
It is a subfield of machine learning which enables AI system to continuously learn and improve accuracy of result by determining whether the decisions made are correct or not. Deeep learning involves large amount of structured or unstructured data and complex algorithms to train neural network. Deep learning requires less human interaction as compared to machine learning.

**`Neural network`: Neural network is inspired by biological neural network or human brain, although they work completely different. Neural network is a collection of small computing units called neurons, which takes in data and train themselves to recognize pattern and predict output for a new set of similar data.
### Natural language preprocessing (NLP):
Natural language preprocessing is a subfield of machine learning which reffers to build machines that understand and respond to text or voice data, in much similar way as humans do. 
## Computer vision:
Computer vision is a field of Artificial intelligence eanabling computers to derive information from images, videos and other inputs.

## `Data science`: 
It is an art of uncovering trends and insights that are hiding behind the data. Or we can say that, it is a tool used in machine learning to deal with data.

**`Brief:`
We are living in 21st century where we have approx 8 billion population of the world and out of which almost 60% people uses digital devices like smartphone, laptop, smartwatch etc. which genrates tons of data per minute. We have different tools available in market to store data at very low cost, different software tools to work with that data which are free and open source then why not to use that data to make our world a better place. 
- As we know data science is a tool used to work with the data. We can use data science to predict natural calamities so that we can prepare early and avoid human and economical losses Ex. Weather forcasting. 
- We can use data science in healthcare industry for predictive analysis of any disease. Ex. Diabetes prediction
- We can use data science almost in every bussiness domain to make the bussiness more profitable using previous data. Ex. Recommendation engine

**`Real world ex.`
At first Netflix is just a postal DVD lending system but later on using data science it became world's foremost video streaming platform. Netflix collects and analyze massive amount of data genrated by thier users including which shows they are watching, at which time of the day they are watching, which shows or actors or directors they are searching for, That's the reason Netflix will be confident about people's preference before even the filming start.



`What is data scientist and what they do?`
- Data scientist is someone who finds solution to problems by analysing big or small data using appropriate tools and communicate the findings to the relevent project stock holders. First, They collects or gather data whether it is in a structured or unstructured format then, they analyze data according to the problem statement or the organizational need and visualize data using powerfull visualization tools to make it understandable easily to the organization's project stock holders.

`What are the different helpful programming languages for data science and machine learning?`
- First, R which is mainly used for statistical analysis. The primary objective of R is Data analysis and Statistics.R provides flexibility to use available libraries.
- Second is Python which provides a more general approach to data science. The primary objective of Python is Deployment and Production. Python provides flexibility to construct new models from scratch.

`What all skills that are required for data scientist?`
- Curiosity, Passionate, Domain specific knowledge, Problem solving ability, Great presentation, Storytelling skills, Can work with structured and unstructured data.

`Which is better ML or DL?`
- Deep learning models deals with massive amount of data having millions of rows. Whereas Ml models takes small size of data that's why it takes less time in training. Ml models are easier to build as compared to DL but requires more human interaction. Whereas Dl requires less human interaction.

`What are the different software tools which are useful in data science?`
1) Data management tool: Database (SQL: MySQL, NoSQL: mongoDB)
2) Bussiness intellegence tools: Power Bi, Tableau
3) Code asset management tools: Git
4) Developement enviourment tool: Jupyter

`**Jupyter`
It is a browser based application which allows you to create and share document that contains code, visualization and narrative text. Mostly in companies JupyterHub is used where you do not have to take care of installing and monitoring libraries, It brings a gropu of users together. Originally, It is developed as Ipython which only suppoert python language. Later on, as it supports many languages, It was renamed to jupyter (Julia [Ju] + Python [py] interpretor [ter])

`**kernal`
It is a computational engine that executes code.
